+ * -EUCLEAN: Any sort of corruption that we encounter.  The tree-checker for

+ *  that is problematic.  We want to reserve -EUCLEAN for these sort of
+ *  corruptions.
+ *
+ * -EROFS: If we check BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR and fail out with a return error, we
+ *  need to use -EROFS for this case.  We will have no idea of the original
+ *  failure, that will have been reported at the time we tripped over the error.
+ *  Each subsequent error that doesn't have any context of the original error
+ *  should use -EROFS when handling BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR.
